Paper2.0:

   WORLD
	World Grid for world states
	Known Grid for visible world, gotten from from WG
	Each grid made of spaces, default BS within WG
	Blank Space is default
	Outside space is extra option, not saved in anything (or around WG?)
	If a space in KG is outside WG, it fills with 'outside' space

   WORLD w/ PLAYER
	Territory Space saved in WG w/ type and/or color
	Movement Space saved in WG w/ type and/or color
	Player Space saved in KG, center space w/ color
	Player starts with PS, square of Gotten space
	Known Grid centers on PS while PS is alive

   PLAYER MOVEMENT
	Player can move, default going straight
	Player moves one space per time frame
	Player can change direction right or left in any given TF
	As Player 'moves', KG moves across WG

   PLAYER EFFECT
	If player is outside own TS, each space it moves over becomes MS
	If player enters own TS, MS and enclosed becomes own TS
	If player enters own MS, player dies
	If player enters OS, player dies
	When player dies, PS, MS, and TS become BS, movement ceases

   MULTIPLAYER
	Other player(s) has same experience, different color PS, TS, and MS
	If playerN enters playerM MS, playerM dies, playerN gets killpoint
	If playerN enters playerM TS, each M TS went over becomes N MS, can enclose N TS
	Territory Score is player's total TS
	Kill Score is player's total kills
	Time is time frames passed


PaperAI:
   BASIC NET
	Input is Known Grid
	Output is Player turn (only three options: straight, left, right)
	Hopefully:
		Recognize player spaces, own v. otherwise (can check? change colors?)
			What happens if same color? Should save own spaces?
		Calculate Safe movement, avoid death
			Defense and Offense, I'm not sure which will win
		Maximize space gains through geometry
		Develop tactics for self-preservation
   POLICY NET
	Plus points for territory enclosed.
	Minus points for death (necessary? if dead, no enclosing)
	Want maximize points over time? (time limit?)
	Motivate murder?
